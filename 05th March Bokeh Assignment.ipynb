    "#March Bokeh Assignment\n",
    "\"\"\"Q1. How can you create a Bokeh plot using Python code?\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  To create a Bokeh plot using Python code, you need to import the Bokeh library and use the figure() function to create a \n",
    "figure object. Then, you can use the various plotting functions such as line(), circle(), and rect() to add elements to the \n",
    "plot. Finally, you can use the show() function to display the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "from bokeh.plotting import figure\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a figure object\n",
    "p = figure()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add elements to the plot\n",
    "p.line([1,2,3], [4,5,6])  # line plot \n",
    "p.circle([1,2,3], [4,5,6])  # circle plot\n",
    "p.rect([1,2,3], [4,5,6], width=0.5, height=0.5)  # rect plot\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show the plot\n",
    "p.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q2. What are glyphs in Bokeh, and how can you add them to a Bokeh plot? Explain with an example.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Glyphs are the visual markers that Bokeh uses to represent data in a plot. They can be circles, squares, lines, wedges, \n",
    "and many other shapes. To add a glyph to a Bokeh plot, you use the glyph() method. For example, to add a circle glyph to a plot,\n",
    "you would use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "from bokeh.plotting import figure\n",
    "\n",
    "p = figure()\n",
    "p.circle(x, y) # x and y are the coordinates of the points to be plotted\n",
    "p.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q3. How can you customize the appearance of a Bokeh plot, including the axes, title, and legend?\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: You can customize the appearance of a Bokeh plot by using the figure() function. This function allows you to set the title,\n",
    "x-axis label, y-axis label, and legend. You can also use the tools parameter to add additional tools such as panning, zooming, \n",
    "and saving. Additionally, you can use the line() and circle() functions to customize the appearance of lines and circles in the\n",
    "plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you can use the styling functions such as color(), line_width(), and alpha() to customize the appearance of the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q4. What is a Bokeh server, and how can you use it to create interactive plots that can be updated in\n",
    "real time?\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: A Bokeh server is a web application that allows users to create interactive plots and data visualizations in a browser. \n",
    "It can be used to create dynamic, interactive plots that can be updated in real time. The Bokeh server provides a powerful and \n",
    "flexible way to create interactive data visualizations, allowing users to quickly and easily create interactive plots that can \n",
    "be shared with others. The Bokeh server also provides a way to embed interactive plots in web pages and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bokeh server can be used to create interactive plots that can be updated in real time by using widgets such as sliders, \n",
    "dropdowns, and buttons. These widgets allow users to interact with the plot and update it in real time. Additionally, the Bokeh\n",
    "server provides a way to embed interactive plots in web pages and applications. This allows users to share their interactive \n",
    "plots with others, allowing them to explore the data in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q5. How can you embed a Bokeh plot into a web page or dashboard using Flask or Django?\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: You can embed a Bokeh plot into a web page or dashboard using Flask or Django by creating a Bokeh server application and \n",
    "then embedding the application into the web page or dashboard. The Bokeh server application can be created using the bokeh.\n",
    "server.Server class, which provides a way to create a Bokeh server application that can be embedded into a web page or dashboard.\n",
    "Once the Bokeh server application is created, it can be embedded into the web page or dashboard using HTML tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you are using Flask, you can use the following code to embed a Bokeh plot into a web page or dashboard:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "  {{ bokeh_plot|safe }}\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Where bokeh_plot is the Bokeh server application created using the bokeh.server.Server class.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Django, you can use the following code to embed a Bokeh plot into a web page or dashboard:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "  {% bokeh_plot %}\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Where bokeh_plot is the Bokeh server application created using the bokeh.server.Server class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, the Bokeh server application will be embedded into the web page or dashboard and can be interacted with by the \n",
    "user."
